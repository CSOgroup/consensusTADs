\title{Select optimal non-overlapping TADs using a single threshold}
\usage{
select_tads_by_threshold(
  tb_tool_sel,
  threshold,
  include_threshold = TRUE,
  considering_width = TRUE,
  include_isolated = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tb_tool_sel}{Data frame containing TAD information with columns: chr, start, end, meta.tool}

\item{threshold}{Numeric value, threshold for filtering TADs based on MoC score}

\item{include_threshold}{Logical, whether to include TADs equal to the threshold, default is TRUE}

\item{considering_width}{Logical, whether to adjust scores by TAD width, default is TRUE}

\item{include_isolated}{Logical, whether to include isolated TADs (with no overlaps) when threshold is 0, default is FALSE}
}
\value{
Data frame containing the selected optimal non-overlapping TADs
}
\description{
This function selects a set of optimal non-overlapping TADs by first filtering
TADs based on the provided MoC threshold, then applying a global optimization
algorithm to select TADs that maximize the total score without overlaps.
