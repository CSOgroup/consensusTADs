\title{Calculate and filter Measure of Concordance (MoC) between TADs}
\usage{
moc_score_filter(tb_tool_sel, moc_cut, include_moc_cut = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tb_tool_sel}{Data frame containing TAD coordinates. Must include columns: chr, start, end, meta.tool}

\item{moc_cut}{Numeric value, threshold for MoC}

\item{include_moc_cut}{Logical, whether to include results equal to MoC threshold, default is TRUE}
}
\value{
Data frame containing merged TAD information with calculated MoC scores and the following columns:
\item{chr}{Character, the chromosome name where the TAD is located}
\item{start}{Integer, the start coordinate of the TAD}
\item{end}{Integer, the end coordinate of the TAD}
\item{moc_score}{Numeric, the Measure of Concordance (MoC) score calculated for the TAD,
representing the level of agreement between different TADs}
\item{score_source}{Character, a string containing information about the tools that
contributed to this TAD and their individual MoC scores}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Measure of Concordance (MoC) between TADs in the input data frame
and filters significant overlaps based on a threshold. The MoC is calculated as:
intersect.width^2 / (width1 * width2), where intersect.width is the overlap length between two regions,
and width1 and width2 are the lengths of the two regions.

# Prepare input data
tad_data <- data.frame(
  chr = rep("chr1", 3),
  start = c(10000, 20000, 50000),
  end = c(30000, 45000, 65000),
  meta.tool = c("tool1", "tool2", "tool3")
)

# Calculate MoC
results <- moc_score_filter(tad_data, moc_cut = 0.1)
