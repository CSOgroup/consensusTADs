Description: Integrates Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) predictions
    from multiple computational tools to generate high-confidence consensus TAD sets.
    The package implements the Measure of Concordance (MoC) metric to quantify
    agreement between different TAD predictions and uses dynamic programming
    algorithms to select optimal non-overlapping TAD boundaries. This approach
    helps resolve inconsistencies between TAD calling methods and produces more
    reliable chromatin domain annotations for downstream genomic analyses.
